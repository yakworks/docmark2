# TL;DR Cheat Sheet

For a 60 second quick start on Markdown
[commonmark has a great tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/){.new-tab}

## Emphasis

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```md
this is _italic_ and so is *this*  <br>
this is __bold__ and so is **this**  <br>
^^underline^^, ^^__bold underline__^^  
~~strike through~~
==highlight==  
==*you* **can** ^^combine^^ ~~too~~==  
can do code `inline like this x=2`
```

## Soft & Hard Line Breaks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```md
Put 2 spaces at the end of a line  
to force a line break like this just did.
just hitting enter doesnt work. 
Can use a `<br>` as well to force a break like <br>
we just did
```

## Lists

`mdx_truly_sane_lists` make lists more sane

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```md
- need a blank line above to start new list
- valid bullet symbols `*`, `-` or '+'
- nested lists
    - 2 space indent when using mdx_truly_sane_lists
    - 4 spaces when using stock sane_lists

1. use *numbers* for ordered
  1. nest indents need to be 4 spaces
  2. foo

2. **numbers** can be in order
  1. can also nest

3. but it will fix them if not

- list item with multiple paragraphs.

  anything like this paragraph
  
  should be indented by 2 or 4 spaces

-   you can add blocks too, just indent by 2-4 spaces

    > :memo: **Note:**
    >
    > - list under lists
    > - under lists

- add tables too

  foo | bar
  ----|----
  some|data

- add some code, indent by 6 spaces

      var x=4

- add some code, using tiks
```

var x=4

```
this is part of the same list

- all done
```

## Tasks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```md
- [ ] Task Lists `- [ ]`
  - [x] x instead of space
  - [x] will mark it complete
- [ ] work just like lists
  - can can contain indents
  - or anything else a list can

1. Or can be nested under others lists
  - [ ] like this
  - [ ] and this

2. This can help
  - [ ] like this
  - [ ] and this
```

## Links

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```md
[simple link](https://www.google.com )
[with optional title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
point to a [relative file or md](./embedding/lucid.md) or
mail link with emoji [üìß](mailto:joshdev@9ci.com) or

[_cloud_{.icon}](https://material.io/icons/)

or [use an image ![](images/dingus/image-small.png)](images/dingus/image.png)

put link at bottom of paragraph or page.
you can use numbers or text for
[reference-style link definitions][1]
or leave it empty and
just use the [link text itself]

to [open in new tab](sandbox.md){.new-tab}
use `{target=_blank} or {.new-tab}` attributes
use it on [ref links][new tab]{.new-tab} too

Indenting _reference links_
2 spaces is not required
but a recommended convention

## Tables

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```Markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.
3 dashes min to separate headers.
Outer pipes (|) are optional,
and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily.
You can also use inline Markdown.

|  Tables  |      Are      |   Cool    |
| -------- |:-------------:| ---------:|
| col 3 is | right-aligned |     $1600 |
| col 2 is |   centered    |       $12 |
|          |   **Total**   |   **$1612** |

==Table== | **Format** | üëÄ _scramble_
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
[with links](images/dingus/image-small.png) | images ![zoomify](images/dingus/image-small.png){.tiny} | emojis üçî
icons _cloud_{.icon} | footnotes[^1] | use `<br>` <br> for multi-line <br> line breaks

### Blockquotes

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

```Markdown
> Blockquotes are handy to callout text.
they are greedy and will keep
grabbing text. The '>' is optional unless trying join
>
paragraphs, tables etc.

a blank line and a new paragraph
or other markdown thing end them

>:bulb:
use a `---` seperator or `<br>`
if you want multiple sepearte block quotes

---

> can have nested
> > blockquotes inside of block quotes
block quotes can also contain any valid markdown

```

### Row Divs

````
<div markdown="1" class="two-column">{++markdown="1" tells it to process what inside++}
    {== <-needs to be a blank line for github to parse==}

```markdown
|foo | bar |
|----|-----|
|baz | buzz|
```

</div>
<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

|foo | bar |
|----|-----|
|baz | buzz|

</div>  {== closes the div ==}

--- {== this clears the "float" REQUIRED when done==}
````
